## Computer Vision

## Natural Language Processing

### CS224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning
* Description: Natural language processing (NLP) is a crucial part of artificial intelligence (AI), modeling how people share information. In recent years, deep learning approaches have obtained very high performance on many NLP tasks. In this course, students gain a thorough introduction to cutting-edge neural networks for NLP.

## Unsupervised Learning

### CS294-158-SP20: Deep Unsupervised Learning
* Description: This course will cover two areas of deep learning in which labeled data is not required: Deep Generative Models and Self-supervised Learning. Recent advances in generative models have made it possible to realistically model high-dimensional raw data such as natural images, audio waveforms and text corpora. Strides in self-supervised learning have started to close the gap between supervised representation learning and unsupervised representation learning in terms of fine-tuning to unseen tasks. This course will cover the theoretical foundations of these topics as well as their newly enabled applications.

## Mathematics and Theory

### Mathematics for Machine Learning
* Description: For a lot of higher level courses in Machine Learning and Data Science, you find you need to freshen up on the basics in mathematics - stuff you may have studied before in school or university, but which was taught in another context, or not very intuitively, such that you struggle to relate it to how itâ€™s used in Computer Science. This specialization aims to bridge that gap, getting you up to speed in the underlying mathematics, building an intuitive understanding, and relating it to Machine Learning and Data Science.

### Deep learning theory lecture notes
* Description: Aim to provide simplified proofs over what appears in the literature, ideally reducing difficult things to something that fits in a single lecture. Primarily focused on a classical perspective of achieving a low test error for binary classification with IID data via standard (typically ReLU) feedforward networks.

## Applications

### CS5785: Applied Machine Learning
* Description: Learn and apply key concepts of modeling, analysis and validation from Machine Learning, Data Mining and Signal Processing to analyze and extract meaning from data. Implement algorithms and perform experiments on images, text, audio and mobile sensor measurements.

### Full Stack Deep Learning
* Description: There are many great courses to learn how to train deep neural networks. However, training the model is just one part of shipping a deep learning project. This course teaches full-stack production deep learning: formulating the problem and estimating project cost; finding, cleaning, labeling, and augmenting data; picking the right framework and compute infrastructure; troubleshooting training and ensuring reproducibility; deploying the model at scale.

This class is designed to help students develop a deeper understanding of deep learning and explore new research directions and applications of AI/deep learning. The course goes in depth on cutting-edge topics within deep learning and their applications, including recent advances in neural architecture design, robustness and reliability of neural networks under adversarial and anomalous attack, learning with less supervision, deep generative modeling, theoretical understanding of deep learning, as well as explaining black-box deep learning models to enhance their transparency. It assumes that students already have a basic understanding of deep learning.

### CSC2541 Topics in Machine Learning: Neural Net Training Dynamics
* Description: Neural nets have achieved amazing results over the past decade in domains as broad as vision, speech, language understanding, medicine, robotics, and game playing. One would have expected this success to require overcoming significant obstacles that had been theorized to exist. After all, the optimization landscape is nonconvex, highly nonlinear, and high-dimensional, so why are we able to train these networks? In many cases, they have far more than enough parameters to memorize the data, so why do they generalize well? This class is about developing the conceptual tools to understand what happens when a neural net trains.
