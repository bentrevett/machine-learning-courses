### CS229 Machine Learning
Description:  CS229 provides a broad introduction to statistical machine learning (at an intermediate / advanced level) and covers supervised learning (generative/discriminative learning, parametric/non-parametric learning, neural networks, support vector machines); unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, kernel methods); learning theory (bias/variance tradeoffs, practical ); and reinforcement learning among other topics. The structure of the summer offering enables coverage of additional topics, places stronger emphasis on the mathematical and visual intuitions, and goes deeper into the details of various topics.

## Computer Vision

## Natural Language Processing

### CS224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning
Description: Natural language processing (NLP) is a crucial part of artificial intelligence (AI), modeling how people share information. In recent years, deep learning approaches have obtained very high performance on many NLP tasks. In this course, students gain a thorough introduction to cutting-edge neural networks for NLP.

### NLP Course | For You
Description: NLP course covering: word embeddings, text classification, language modeling, sequence-to-sequence models, attention, and transfer learning.

## Unsupervised Learning

### CS294-158-SP20: Deep Unsupervised Learning
Description: This course will cover two areas of deep learning in which labeled data is not required: Deep Generative Models and Self-supervised Learning. Recent advances in generative models have made it possible to realistically model high-dimensional raw data such as natural images, audio waveforms and text corpora. Strides in self-supervised learning have started to close the gap between supervised representation learning and unsupervised representation learning in terms of fine-tuning to unseen tasks. This course will cover the theoretical foundations of these topics as well as their newly enabled applications.

## Reinforcement Learning

## Theory

### Deep learning theory lecture notes
Description: Aim to provide simplified proofs over what appears in the literature, ideally reducing difficult things to something that fits in a single lecture. Primarily focused on a classical perspective of achieving a low test error for binary classification with IID data via standard (typically ReLU) feedforward networks.

## Miscellaneous

### CS839 Special Topics in Deep Learning
Description: In recent years, deep learning has enabled huge progress in many domains including computer vision, speech, NLP, and robotics. This class is designed to help students develop a deeper understanding of deep learning and explore new research directions and applications of AI/deep learning. The course goes in depth on cutting-edge topics within deep learning and their applications, including recent advances in neural architecture design, robustness and reliability of neural networks under adversarial and anomalous attack, learning with less supervision, deep generative modeling, theoretical understanding of deep learning, as well as explaining black-box deep learning models to enhance their transparency. It assumes that students already have a basic understanding of deep learning.

### CSC2541 Topics in Machine Learning: Neural Net Training Dynamics
Description: Neural nets have achieved amazing results over the past decade in domains as broad as vision, speech, language understanding, medicine, robotics, and game playing. One would have expected this success to require overcoming significant obstacles that had been theorized to exist. After all, the optimization landscape is nonconvex, highly nonlinear, and high-dimensional, so why are we able to train these networks? In many cases, they have far more than enough parameters to memorize the data, so why do they generalize well? This class is about developing the conceptual tools to understand what happens when a neural net trains.
