### CS839 Special Topics in Deep Learning
Description: In recent years, deep learning has enabled huge progress in many domains including computer vision, speech, NLP, and robotics. This class is designed to help students develop a deeper understanding of deep learning and explore new research directions and applications of AI/deep learning. The course goes in depth on cutting-edge topics within deep learning and their applications, including recent advances in neural architecture design, robustness and reliability of neural networks under adversarial and anomalous attack, learning with less supervision, deep generative modeling, theoretical understanding of deep learning, as well as explaining black-box deep learning models to enhance their transparency. It assumes that students already have a basic understanding of deep learning.
